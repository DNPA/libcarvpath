The CarvPath library has the following prerequisites:

* cmake.
* sqlite3 development files.
* openssl development files.

To build the library run:

  cmake src
  make

To make sure everything works correctly you could run:

  make test

To install the library use the following command:

  sudo make install
  sudo /sbin/ldconfig


This version of LibCarvPath has been tested to run on 64 bit x86 linux, but care has been 
taken in development to avoid non portable constructs. In theory LibCarvPath should build
and run on at least all *NIX like systems. There is even a reasonable change that it will
build and run on MS-Windows, but this has not been validated.

Note: There is also a 'configure' file. "DON'T USE IT". Its there only for people who don't 
      read files like this one, so they have a good change of getting everything build when
      blindly using 'configure','make','sudo make install'. This subproject uses the cmake
      build system.
